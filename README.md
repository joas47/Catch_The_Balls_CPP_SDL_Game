# Catch the balls!
Author: joas47

# How to play.
Use the arrow keys to move the player left and right. 
Try to catch the falling objects with the player.
If you miss an object you will lose a life.
If you lose all your lives the game is over.
If you catch an object you will get points.
The game will get harder the more points you get.

# How to compile and run the game
To compile the game you need to have the following SDL2 libraries installed:
SDL2, SDL2_ttf, SDL2_image, and SDL2_mixer.

The resources folder needs to be in the same folder as the executable file.

CMakeLists.txt might need to change the path to your SDL folders here.

The compiled executable is in the root folder: CatchTheBalls.exe
